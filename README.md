## How to use

### 1. Print Sticker Labels

Each image fits within a 0.75" x 1" area, the typical size of a full-size SD card. You can buy label paper and print at home (typically requires a color laser printer), or print using an online service.

**Buy SD Card Adapter:** Coming soon, purchase pre-made individual SD card adapters with your preferred sticker

### 2. Label SD Card Adapters

Either cut or peel your stickers and affix them to the _full-size_ SD card adapters.

### 3. Mark MicroSD Card

Each SD Card design has an ID number mark in the bottom left corner. Use a fine-tip permanent marker to label the microSD with the corresponding number to ensure the correct card adapter is kept with the correct card.

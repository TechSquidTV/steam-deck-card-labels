## How to Use

### 1. Print (Or Buy) Sticker Labels

- **Dimensions**: Each label is designed to fit within a 0.75" x 1" area, the typical size for a full-size SD card front label.
- **Printing at Home**: Use label paper and a color laser printer for best results. OL28 blank label paper is recommended
- **Online Printing Services**: Use an online service to have your own OL28 sheets printed if you do not have a printer.
- **Buy Pre-Made Cards**: If you are only interested in getting a few cards, I will soon have some available for sale on my Etsy, and it will be cheaper than printing full sheets.

### 2. Label SD Card Adapters

- Carefully cut or peel your stickers.
- Affix them to your _full-size_ SD card adapters.

### 3. Mark MicroSD Card

- Each design includes an ID number in the bottom left corner.
- Use a fine-tip permanent marker to label the microSD card with the corresponding number.
- **Optional**: It is recommended to mark the background a white paint marker first to make the label easier to read.
